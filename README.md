- EJS
- Axios
- Body-parser

## API Knowledge Demonstrated in This Project

- Implemented a RESTful API using Express.js for the backend, with Axios on the frontend to make asynchronous HTTP requests.

- One of the main challenges in this project was designing and creating the API endpoints. Handling different HTTP methods such as GET, POST, PATCH, and DELETE required careful thought to ensure data was processed correctly, errors were managed properly, and appropriate status codes were returned.

- Developed full CRUD functionality for blog posts using REST principles.

- Ensured frontend-backend communication works smoothly by dynamically rendering API data with EJS templates.

- Implemented error handling, request validation, and used meaningful status codes to indicate the outcome of operations.
